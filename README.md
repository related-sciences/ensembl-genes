# Extract the human ensembl gene catalog to simple tables

This repository extracts a catalog of human genes from the Ensembl database.
It is ideal for situations where you want to represent human genes via stable Ensembl identifiers.
Data is extracted by a series of SQL queries as well as additional transformations in Python using Pandas.
Tables are exported to output branches based on the corresponding Ensembl version in TSV and Parquet format.

## Motivation

NCBI publishes the `Homo_sapiens.gene_info.gz` dataset of human genes with one row per gene.
It includes useful metadata like the gene symbol, synonyms, and chromosome.
However, we weren't able to find a comparable dataset for Ensembl genes (please [let us know](https://github.com/related-sciences/ensembl-genes) if this exists).
Therefore, we combined several SQL queries guided by Biostars answers —
for example to retrieve [symbols](https://www.biostars.org/p/14367/#480311), [alternative sequence allele groups](https://www.biostars.org/p/143956/#144112), and [chromosomes](https://www.biostars.org/p/106355/) —
and from [Open Targets pipelines](https://github.com/opentargets/platform-input-support/blob/b5bf58457ae71a7e32d0dae58340ff5f9d30591d/scripts/ensembl/create_genes_dictionary.py#L46-L78) to extract simplified tabular datasets.

Note that the Ensembl core schema consists of [many tables](https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/core/core_schema.html).
There is a chance we have made mistakes and will appreciate any feedback or contributions.
Please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/related-sciences/ensembl-genes/issues) for contact.

## Usage

Each release received a corresponding output branch.
For example, see the [`output-104`](https://github.com/related-sciences/ensembl-genes/tree/output-104) branch for datasets generated from Ensembl release 104.

If you'd like to download all files for a specific release,
you can use a command like the following (replacing `104` with the desired release number):

```shell
# clone the relevant output branch to a local directory
git clone --branch=output-104 --depth=1 https://github.com/related-sciences/ensembl-genes.git
# optionally uninitialize git from the data directory
cd ensembl-genes && rm -rf .git
```

Maintainers can create exports for new Ensembl releases running the [export workflow](https://github.com/related-sciences/ensembl-genes/actions/workflows/export.yaml)
(which is a `workflow_dispatch` GitHub Action).
In addition, CI checks for a new Ensembl release every week,
as reported by [Bioversions](https://biopragmatics.github.io/bioversions/),
and runs an export if none already exists for that release.

## Development

```shell
# Install the environment
poetry install --no-root

# Update the lock file
poetry update

# Export datasets to output (change 104 to desired release)
poetry run ensembl_genes datasets --release=104

# Export notebooks to output (change 104 to desired release)
poetry run ensembl_genes notebooks --release=104

# Run tests
pytest

# Set up the git pre-commit hooks.
# `git commit` will now trigger automatic checks including linting.
pre-commit install

# Run all pre-commit checks (CI will also run this).
pre-commit run --all
```
